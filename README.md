# To-Do List Application

## Overview

This is a simple yet functional To-Do List application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, completing, and deleting items. It features persistent storage using `localStorage` to save and load tasks between sessions.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can input and add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Tasks can be edited by toggling their editable state.
- **Complete Tasks:** Users can mark tasks as completed, which applies a strikethrough effect.
- **Delete Tasks:** Tasks can be removed from the list.
- **Filter Tasks:** Tasks can be filtered based on their completion status:
  - **All:** Displays all tasks.
  - **Completed:** Shows only completed tasks.
  - **Uncompleted:** Shows only tasks that are not completed.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so they persist across page reloads.

## Code Overview

- **HTML (`index.html`):** Defines the structure of the application.
- **CSS (`styles.css`):** Styles the application and defines the layout.
- **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Contains the logic for managing tasks, handling user interactions, and storing data in `localStorage`.

## Local Storage

- **Saving Tasks:** When tasks are added, edited, or deleted, the `storeCode` function updates `localStorage` with the current list of tasks.
- **Loading Tasks:** On page load, the `loadCode` function retrieves tasks from `localStorage` and populates the list.
